# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Environment

This app uses Firebase (client-safe config) and a secure AI proxy (server-only secret) via Firebase Functions.

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (do not commit `.env`).
- Fill in the `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` Firebase values from your project settings.
- Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_PROXY_URL` to your Firebase Functions base URL (no trailing slash, and without `/revamp`). Example:

   EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_PROXY_URL="https://us-central1-your-project-id.cloudfunctions.net"

The app will POST to `${EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_PROXY_URL}/revamp` at runtime. Do not put AI provider keys in the client.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
