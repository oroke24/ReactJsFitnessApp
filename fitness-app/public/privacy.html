    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Fit Cards helps you plan recipes and exercises. We respect your privacy and only collect the minimum data needed for the app to function.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Account data: your email address (for sign-in and identification).</li>
      <li>User content: recipes, exercises, and day schedules you create.</li>
      <li>Basic device and usage data for error reporting and service reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core app features (authentication, saving and syncing your content).</li>
      <li>Securely call our AI proxy to assist with content formatting and improvements (when you request it).</li>
      <li>Maintain service reliability and prevent abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We use trusted service providers to operate Fit Cards, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Firebase (authentication, database, storage).</li>
      <li>Google Cloud Functions (our AI proxy endpoint).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AI Features</h2>
    <p>When you use AI features, your prompts and the relevant card content are sent to our server proxy, which forwards the request to an AI model provider. We do not include your sign-in credentials or other unrelated personal data in these requests.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Data is encrypted in transit. Access to your data is restricted to your account and stored securely in the cloud.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete your account and associated content from within the app (Account → Delete Account). You may also contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Fit Cards is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us personal information, please contact us and we will remove it.</p>
